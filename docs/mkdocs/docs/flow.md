🔁 Message Flow (High-Level)
1. Message Sent
A user sends a text message to the system.
2. AI Interpretation
The server analyzes the message to determine:
Intent (e.g., request, offer, announcement)
Constraints (location, availability, relevance)
Context (past interactions, opt-in signals)
The system generates a suggested recipient list, along with reasoning.
3. Moderator Review
The system sends a summary to a human moderator, including:
Interpreted intent and need
The suggested recipient list
The moderator may approve, modify, or restrict the list.
4. System Action
Based on the moderator’s input, the system either:
Adjusts the recipient list and repeats Step 3, or
Sends the original message to the confirmed recipients only.
5. Recipient Confirmation
Recipients reply to the system (not directly to the original sender).
6. AI Interpretation (Responses)
The server analyzes recipient replies to determine:
Intent (e.g., acceptance, report, concern)
Whether a handoff between parties is appropriate
The system either:
Shares contact information with both parties when a handoff is ready, or
Sends an analyzed response or concern to the moderator.
7. Moderator Decision (Optional)
The moderator receives a summary and may:
Take further action
Share updates with participants
Close the loop
