“TextRoute helps route messages and connect members to borrow items.
By continuing, you agree to our Terms & Privacy Policy:

You need clear, informed, voluntary, and revocable consent for collecting and using information about a person’s possessions—especially because:

It’s personal data
It can imply wealth, lifestyle, or household details
It enables matching and routing, not just storage
You don’t need one kind of consent — you need layered consent.
✅ The 4 Types of Consent You Should Use
1️⃣ Explicit Opt-In for “Possession Listing”
What this covers
Items someone owns
Items they are willing to lend or borrow
Metadata like condition, availability, location radius
How to do it
This must be opt-in, not assumed.
Example language (simple, clear):
“I agree to share information about items I own so other members can request to borrow them.”
UX pattern
Checkbox or SMS reply like YES
Cannot be bundled with general Terms acceptance
No pre-checked boxes
✅ This consent allows you to store possessions
❌ It does not automatically allow matching, profiling, or suggestions
2️⃣ Purpose-Limited Consent (Use of the Data)
You must be explicit about how the possession data is used.
You should clearly state:
Items are used to:
Suggest potential lenders
Route borrow requests
Reduce group-message noise
Items are not:
Publicly listed without permission
Sold or shared with third parties
Used for advertising
Example language:
“Your item information will only be used to connect you with relevant borrowing or lending requests within your community.”
This is crucial for trust, especially in churches and nonprofits.
3️⃣ Ongoing / Incremental Consent (Profile Improvement)
This is the part many apps get wrong.
You’re proposing to:
Infer or improve a member profile over time
That requires progressive consent, not a one-time “gotcha”.
Best practice
Ask permission when the value becomes clear.
Example moment:
“Based on past messages, it looks like you may have tools that could help others. Would you like TextRoute to remember this for future requests?”
User options:
✅ Yes, remember this
❌ No, don’t store
⚙️ Review my profile
This keeps you out of “silent profiling” territory.
4️⃣ Revocation & Control (Critical)
Consent must be reversible.
Users should be able to:
View what items are associated with them
Edit or delete items
Pause participation
Opt out entirely
Minimum controls
“Remove this item”
“Stop lending suggestions”
“Delete my lending profile”
If users can’t undo it, it’s not real consent.
📌 What You Should NOT Do
🚫 Automatically infer possessions without telling users
🚫 Build hidden “ownership profiles”
🚫 Share inferred items with moderators without user awareness
🚫 Assume silence = consent
Even if technically legal, these break community trust.
🛡️ Special Considerations (Important)
Sensitive inferences
Possessions can imply:
Income level
Family size
Disabilities (medical equipment)
Trades / employment
👉 Never infer or label these.
Stick strictly to items, not attributes.
Children / youth groups
If TextRoute is used in churches:
Do not collect possession data from minors
Require guardian-managed profiles
Moderator visibility
Moderators should see:
“This member opted in to lending”
Not full possession lists unless necessary
🧾 Suggested Consent Structure (What I’d recommend)
At onboarding
✅ Agree to Terms
✅ Opt-in to “Borrow & Lend” feature
First item
Explicit consent to store that item
Over time
Periodic, contextual prompts:
“Save this for future matches?”
Anytime
Profile view + delete options
✨ Trust-Building Language (Highly recommended)
TextRoute will stand out if you say things like:
“You are always in control of what TextRoute remembers.”
“Nothing is shared without your permission.”
“You can participate without listing any items.”
This aligns perfectly with your noise-reduction + trust-preserving philosophy.
