TextRoute

📢 Project Overview

Reduce group-message noise by routing messages only to the people who are likely relevant—without requiring the sender to manage recipients.

This project explores how AI can quietly improve group communication by ensuring messages reach the right people at the right time—while preserving inclusiveness, transparency, and community trust.

Instead of broadcasting every message to everyone, the system intelligently routes messages based on intent, context, and relevance—without requiring users to learn a new app or workflow.

Everything happens through plain text messages.

🌱 Purpose & Philosophy

Group messaging is powerful—but often noisy. Important messages get lost, people feel overwhelmed, and frustration builds when messages meant for a few reach everyone.

This project aims to:
  • Promote unity and cooperation, especially in times of need
  • Respect people’s attention without excluding anyone unfairly
  • Lower friction in asking for help, offering help, or sharing information
  • Keep humans in the loop, especially for sensitive or ambiguous cases

The system is designed to assist communities, not control them.
